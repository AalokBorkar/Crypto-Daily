# Crypto Daily
A modern website for tracking personalized cryptocurrency data in real time.

# Motivation
With the recent spike in cryptocurrency' popularity throughout the world, we have seen a surge in digital currency data tracking websites. Although many have been created, most of these websites lack the ability to quickly check cryptocurrency data tailored specifically towards individual users. After experiencing the frustration of this issue myself, I set off to create a web application that solves this very issue, and provides users with a personalized and easy way to dynamically check cryptocurrency data in real time.

# Technologies and Frameworks
The front-end aspects of Crypto Daily were created using Handlebars Javascript framework for dynamic page rendering, JQuery for functionality, and CSS3 for styling. The back-end server of the application was written using NodeJS with Express for middleware routing and effecient data throughput. All of the data that Crypto Daily uses comes directly from Crypto Daily also utilizes a MongoDB data store for maintaining the influx of cryptocurrency data as well as robustness of the application itself.


# Languages Used
*Application popup built using HTML, Javascript (JQuery, Mark.JS), & CSS3
*Background script build using Javascript (Chrome Messaging API, Chrome Tabs API)
